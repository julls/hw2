If you think of a particle accelerator, what may come to mind is something like CERN’s Large Hadron 
Collider (LHC): a multibillion-dollar colossus that’s dozens of miles
 wide and crosses international borders in the name of unlocking how the universe works.
But particle accelerators take many forms. There are more than 30,000 accelerators in the world today.
 While some of them—including LHC—are designed to unveil the universe’s secrets, the vast majority have far more Earthly
  purposes. They’re used for everything from generating beams of brilliant light to manufacturing electronics to imaging 
  the body and treating cancer. In fact, a hospital can buy a room-sized medical accelerator for just a few hundred thousand 
  dollars. And, as of last month, 
scientists have made another curious addition to the list: the smallest particle accelerator yet.
